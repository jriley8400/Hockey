1. Someone enters 5 stars and a goalie from different teams and pits them against another team. The program chooses the better team.

2. Someone enters average players and an average goalie and faces them against another team with good players. The program chooses the program with the good players.

3. Someone doesn't know who the goalie is for the Chicago Blackhawks. He can check my site to see that their goalies are Corey Crawford and Antti Raanta.
